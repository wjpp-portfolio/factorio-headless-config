# Factorio headless config
 config files and scripts for configuring and running a factorio headless server on aws from Windows desktop
 
 ## Prereqs
 .pem keypair created and downloaded into Downloads folder locally

 ## Steps
 1. start instance in aws
    - Linux AIM
    - t2.medium or t2.large
    - SSH and UDP 34197 inbound
    - default EBS storage (8gb)
    - Auto-assign public IP
 3. paste instance address into `ec2_instance` variable in `factorio_server_config.bat`
 4. rename `pem_key` variable to correct file name
 5. run `factorio_server_config.bat`

## factorio_server_config.bat
### 1. configure new instance
sets up ec2 instance for factorio by creating user, directories, and downloading factorio headless server config and extracting it, and creating a service to run the server.  Also uploads headless server config files.  Note the config of the instance is via uploaded shell script `configure_new_ec2_instance.sh`
### 2. upload save to server
uploads chosen save file from default windows save location to server and starts server service
### 3. upload server config files
uploads config files for headless server and restarts factorio service
### 4. downloads save file
downloads config file from server back into local factorio save directory

## Other
- instance can be terminated after use to free up reseources as config takes ~20 seconds to complete once new instance is running
- if instance is kept, factorio service will auto start the last save file if present on boot
- t2.large is plently and potentially overkill for 2 people
